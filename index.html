            <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
            <p>I created this website mostly out of boredom. I've had some experience in the past
                with HTML and currently work as a data analyst where I don't get to use those skills 
                any longer. 
            </p>
            <p> I plan to create a variety of projects under "Portfolio" to demonstrate my various
                tech skill sets. My first project (currently in it's infancy) is a recipe database. 
                Am I reinventing the wheel? Definitely. Will it be fun? At least some of the time. 
                And I'll definitely learn a whole lot, which is the point of life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, now I have chatGPT which is how I created the shell of a website you're currently viewing.
